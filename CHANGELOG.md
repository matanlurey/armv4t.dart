# CHANGELOG

## 0.1.0

- Initial version. This is intended to be a (_mostly_) faithful implementation
  of an emulator for the [ARMv4T instruction set][], written in Dart, to be used
  for a Gameboy Advance Emulator, as a standalone library (and binary). See the
  [README](./README.md) for details.

- **WARNING**: There are [known issues][]! This is an alpha-quality package that
  is not expected to be stable until it reaches `1.0.0`, though early usage and
  feedback is welcome.
