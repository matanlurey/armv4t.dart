# CHANGELOG

## 0.1.0

- Initial version! This is intended to be a (_mostly_) faithful implementation
  of an emulator for the [ARMv4T instruction set][], written in Dart, to be used
  for a Gameboy Advance Emulator, as a standalone library (and binary). See the
  [README](./README.md) for details.
